# Happiness index of Students 
### Description :
An online survey questionnaire was circulated among the school students, college students and university students across various streams, yielding a total of 132 responses.

### Objective :
The primary goals of this research are outlined as follows:  
1. To develop a Happiness Index that assesses students' overall well-being by analyzing academic, social, and other relevant factors.  
2. To understand the relationship between students’ happiness and various factors such as gender, academic experiences, social relationships, and mental health.  
3. To determine the factors that affect student happiness by utilizing statistical techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), regression analysis.
4. To provide recommendations to improve student well-being through effective institutional policies and support systems.  

### The variables considered :
•	Dependent variable : Happiness score of students (self reported in the questionnaire)
The Cantril Ladder is used to assess life satisfaction. Students were asked to imagine a ladder with steps numbered from 0 at the bottom of the scale to 10 at the top of the scale. The top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you and the bottom represents the worst possible life for you. 
The students were then asked on which step of the ladder they personally stand at this time.
The dependent variable was thus measured on a scale of 0-10 but later , for convenience, was converted into a scale of 0-4 (Likert scale).
